symfony-ecommerce
=================

A project made following this formation on Grafikart : https://www.grafikart.fr/formations/sf2-ecommerce
The author of the formation is Benjamin Catelain, http://www.devandclick.fr

The formation is based on Symfony 2.4. The goal for me is to learn Symfony 3 and how to use github, so I would like to follow the formation while in the meantime adapting the code to Symfony 3, and publish it on github.
